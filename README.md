It fetches data from a reliable weather API and presents it in a clean and intuitive interface. Whether you need to check the current temperature, humidity, or weather conditions, this app has you covered.

The Weather Application is built using the following core web technologies to ensure simplicity and ease of use:

JavaScript:

Powers the interactive and dynamic functionality of the application. Manages tasks such as adding, editing, and deleting items. Handles user input and updates the DOM (Document Object Model) to reflect changes in real-time. Implements features like task prioritization, due dates, and reminders using local storage to maintain data persistence across sessions.
